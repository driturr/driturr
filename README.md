- 👋 Hi, I’m @driturr
- 👀 I like video art, climbing, piano & meta-language. I also organise some events.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying cybersecurity in a 2 year pentesting program.
- 💞️ Open to collaborate on CTF and learn with others.
- 📫 How to reach me: dritur.cyber@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Reaching the top of a climbing route and solving a security challenge push my limits. I love that feeling.
              Both require focus, strategy, and persistence to succeed.
